1, ,2, Pack is an award winning concept from a Woolworths competition. This idea has won the People's Choice Award in 2017.This lunchbox idea allows stressed and tired parents have a break from packing daily school lunches for children. 
Children can go with their parents on their shopping trips and build their own lunches. They can pick out their own main meal such as a sandwich, fruit/veg and a dessert.
All portions are carefully measured to ensure the children can have a nutritous morning tea, and lunch. 
These lunchboxes are available at metro stores, Caltex petrol stores and general stores.
